    <div>this is from the second computer</div>
    <div>This is from the first computer for the third time - now need to learn how to do it by ssh key</div>
    <div>SSH Key is a way to make you authenticated so you can push and pull to the source code - ssh key doesn't require a specific repository its account based , but if you are working with a project
        it will linked to that specific project only , maybe i don't know for sure , and it also helps to setup the name and password to do the push pull which makes it secure too
